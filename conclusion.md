## **1. Written Long After the Events**  

ðŸ“Œ **The Latest Gospel**  
- The **Gospel of John** was written between **90 and 110 AD**, decades after the events it describes.  
- In contrast, **Mark** was written between **65 and 70 AD**, while **Matthew and Luke** were written between **80 and 90 AD**.  

ðŸ“Œ **The Problem of Temporal Distance**  
- The longer the gap between events and their recording, the higher the chances of **exaggerations, theologization, and mythification**.  
- **The Synoptic Gospels were written closer to Jesus' lifetime**, making them **more historically reliable**.  

ðŸ”´ **Conclusion:** The **60 to 80-year gap** between the events and the writing of John increases the likelihood of **alterations and theological inventions**.

## **2. Influence of Greek Philosophy**  

ðŸ“Œ **The Concept of Logos in John 1:1**  
- ðŸ“– **John 1:1** â†’ *"In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."*  
- The term **Logos** has strong connections with **Greek philosophy**, particularly with **Heraclitus and Stoicism**, which viewed Logos as the **cosmic reason governing the universe**.  
- **This concept is foreign to Judaism**, suggesting Hellenistic influence.  

ðŸ“Œ **Jesus Becomes a Metaphysical Being in John**  
- In the Synoptics, Jesus is portrayed as a **Jewish prophet and teacher**, but in John, he takes on a **cosmic and divine role**, distant from historical reality.  

ðŸ”´ **Conclusion:** John is heavily influenced by **Greek philosophical thought**, whereas the Synoptic Gospels maintain a **more authentically Jewish portrayal of Jesus**.

## **3. A Galilean Fisherman Could Not Have Written an Advanced Greek Text**  

ðŸ“Œ **John Was a Fisherman, Not a Scholar**  
- ðŸ“– **Matthew 4:21** â†’ John, the son of Zebedee, was a fisherman in Galilee, a region where the main language was **Aramaic**.  
- ðŸ“– **Acts 4:13** â†’ The apostles are described as **"unschooled, ordinary men."**  

ðŸ“Œ **The Gospel of John Is Written in Sophisticated Greek**  
- The Greek in John is **refined and theological**, which would be unlikely for a Galilean fisherman.  
- Unless John had a **highly educated scribe**, it is improbable that he wrote this gospel.  

ðŸ”´ **Conclusion:** The gospel was not written by the apostle John but by someone using his name to give the text **credibility**.

## **4. Paulâ€™s Letters Never Mention John**  

ðŸ“Œ **Paul Never Mentions John or His Gospel**  
- Paulâ€™s letters, written between **50 and 65 AD**, are the earliest Christian documents.  
- **Paul quotes Jesus and his teachings**, but never mentions **the theological discourses found in John**.  

ðŸ“Œ **If the Gospel of John Already Existed, Why Didnâ€™t Paul Cite It?**  
- Paul cites traditions about the Last Supper (**1 Corinthians 11:23-26**) but **does not mention Jesusâ€™ statements found in John**.  
- If Johnâ€™s discourses were authentic, Paul would have used them to reinforce his theology.  

ðŸ”´ **Conclusion:** The absence of any reference to the Gospel of John in Paulâ€™s letters suggests that it **was not known or widely accepted in Paulâ€™s time**.

## **5. The Structure of Johnâ€™s Gospel Is Artificial, Not Historical**  

ðŸ“Œ **John Organizes His Gospel in a Literary and Theological Way**  
- Instead of following a **natural timeline**, John structures his gospel around **seven signs (miracles) and seven "I Am" statements**.  
- This suggests that **the author was more focused on building a theology rather than recording real history**.  

ðŸ”´ **Conclusion:** John is not a historical account but rather **a theological text intentionally designed to present Jesus as a divine figure**.

## **6. John Breaks Away from the Judaism of Jesus**  

ðŸ“Œ **In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus Stays Within Judaism**  
- ðŸ“– **Matthew 5:17** â†’ *"I did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it."*  
- ðŸ“– **Luke 4:16** â†’ Jesus teaches in synagogues and follows Jewish traditions.  

ðŸ“Œ **In John, Jesus Rejects Judaism**

- ðŸ“– **John 4:21-23** â†’ Jesus says that worship will no longer be in Jerusalem.  

ðŸ”´ **Conclusion:** John transforms Jesus into a figure **above Judaism**, which does not make sense historically.

## **7. The Gospel of John Corrects the Synoptic Gospels**  

ðŸ“Œ **John Appears to Directly Respond to the Synoptics**  
- **In the Synoptics, Jesus performs exorcisms**; in John, **there are no exorcisms**.  
- **In the Synoptics, Jesus teaches in parables**; in John, **there are no parables**.  
- **In the Synoptics, Jesus never explicitly claims to be God**; in John, **he does so clearly**.

- John was written to **correct** or **reinterpret** the other gospels, rather than to be a historical account on its own.  

ðŸ”´ **Conclusion:** John is not an independent gospel but rather **a theological response to the previous gospels**.
